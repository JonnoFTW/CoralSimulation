Coral Simulation
================

A simulation of coral growth based on real world data. Offers the facility to define and simulate an arbitrary number of coral species in a
2D grid.

Installation
------------

* Make sure you have at least java 1.6 installed.
* Run the 'go' class, or just run the included jar file.
* It will setup folders in your home directory to save logs/images/species

Usage
-----

Setup your species in the "Species setup" tab.

Setup your simulation in the simulation tab by clicking cells where you want a single cell of the currently selected species to appear.
You can change what cell species you are placing by selecting it from the panel on the right. New species will be recruited every year
as defined by the species for every species you have defined. If you don't want a species to be recruited, set its recruitment rate to 0.
